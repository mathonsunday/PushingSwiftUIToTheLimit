Pushing SwiftUI To The Limit, SwiftTO 2019

This year Apple announced SwiftUI and developers were thrilled. Hot reloading and cross-platform Apple development 
will be a huge productivity win. Instead of choosing between programmatic and Nib or Storyboard development you get
both at once and they are completely in sync. But your app is complicated and SwiftUI couldn't handle all of it, right? 
I was initially skeptical of SwiftUI's ability to make complex, custom UI but soon realized that its power and vision is
bigger than I initially thought. To demonstrate SwiftUI's power, I'll show how I ported a custom UI control I originally built 
with Core Graphics and UIKit for a new feature at Compass. We'll see SwiftUI's current capabilities and what we can expect 
in the future.
